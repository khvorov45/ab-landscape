\section{Viruses}

The viruses and their clades are in Table \ref{tab:cdc-clade-viruses}. The frequencies of clades throughout the study period are in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-clade-freq} (data from Nextstrain). I assume these global frequencies to be representative of what they were at the sites where the data was collected (Israel and Peru).

\input{../data-summary/cdc-clade-viruses.tex}

\section{Objective 1}

Compare post-vaccination HI antibody titres for frequently vaccinated (in the past) vs infrequently vaccinated.

Hypothesis: post-vaccination titres and the pre/post vaccination titre rise
is lower in the frequently vaccinated.

\subsection{Data}

All data analysed for objective 1 comes from the Israel study sample.

Table \ref{tab:cdc-participant-summary-obj1} contains sex and age summaries.
The majority of subjects in both the frequent and the infrequent group are
women and were around 40 years of age when the study started (2016).

\input{../data-summary/cdc-participant-summary-obj1.tex}

\subsection{HI titres}

Geometric mean titres for each virus at each timepoint for each group (frequently
vaccinated vs infrequently vaccinated) are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-gmts}.
Pre-vaccination GMTs are generally close to the same
or higher for all viruses for the frequently vaccinated.
Post-vaccination GMTs are generally close to the same or higher in the infrequently vaccinated with
the exception of the Bilthoven viruses (which show the same pattern
of frequently vaccinated GMTs being higher at every
timepoint). The pattern of GMTs for the post-season timepoint is close to that
of post-vaccination except that titres are generally more similar between the
frequently and infrequently vaccinated.

	\label{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-gmts}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HI titre changes}

Ratio of post-vaccination titres to pre-vaccination titres is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-diffs}. Ratios are higher for the infrequently
vaccinated for the majority of viruses.

\end{figure}

\subsection{GMT against circulating strains}

The list of viruses for each clade is in Table \ref{tab:cdc-clade-viruses}.Frequencies of different virus clades during the study period are in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-clade-freq}. The timing of sample collection is in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj1-bleed-dates}. The most relevant set of frequencies is the first half of 2019 as it appears to be the influenza "season" that the titres belong to.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj1-bleed-dates.pdf}
	\caption{Bleed dates for objective 1 data. Each horizontal line represents a participant. Points are bleeds.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj1-bleed-dates}
\end{figure}

The average titre against circulating strains was calculated separately for cell and egg viruses. The procedure was as follows. For each individual, calculate mean log titre per clade (only relevant for 3c1 as it is the only clade with more than one virus of each type). Then for each individual, calculate weighted (by clade frequency) mean of clade-specific mean log titres. This yields one observation per individual which can be interpreted as the mean titre against the circulating strains weighted by their frequencies (Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj1-ind-av-circulating}). Then for each group (frequent and infrequent) calculate the mean log titre and its 95\% CI (normal approximation CI for the mean) which can be found in Figure INSERT.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj1-ind-av-circulating.pdf}
	\caption{Weighted average titres agains circulating strains for each individual. Split by group and egg/cell viruses. Colored by individual ID.  The percentage in the top-left corner shows the proportion of circulating flu (as per Nexstrain) accounted for by the strains that were avaraged.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj1-ind-av-circulating}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj1-gmt-circulating.pdf}
	\caption{Means of weighted average titres agains circulating strains for each group. Split by egg/cell.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj1-gmt-circulating}
\end{figure}

Note that we do not have egg/cell pairs for every clade and the clades that we have titre data for do not account for all of the circulating flu. There is also no accounting for the geographic region as its frequencies are assumed to be similar to the global Nexstrain ones.

The frequent group shows higher titres pre-vaccination (especially for the egg viruses) and lower titres post-vaccination (especially for the cell viruses) and well as slightly lower post-season titres for the cell viruses.

\subsection{Interpretation}

The vaccine response (titre change between post and pre vaccination timepoints)
appears to be lower in the frequently vaccinated. However, the actual
post-vaccination titres between the two groups are fairly close for most viruses.

When considering only the circulating viruses, the differences between the groups are more evident --- the frequently vaccinated group shows a smaller vaccine response and lower post-vaccination titres against the cell viruses. Although the metric of "GMT against circulating strains" may be unreliable here due to the lack of titre data for all circulating strains and the lack of egg/cell pairs for all strains.

Both groups had low titres against A/South Australia/34/2019 and A/Sydney/22/2018 pre-vaccination. Those who were infrequently vaccinated had those titres rise to above 20 (on average) while the frequently vaccinated titres stayed below 20 (on average). This indicates that the depressed vaccine response mey be most evident for viruses that individuals have no/low titres against before vaccination (which could be novel strains, for example).

Neither group had a strong response to the Bilthoven viruses. However, the frequently vaccinated group had higher titres against them throughout the season. This is likely due to the fact that while the current vaccine did not generate antibody production against these viruses, one of the previous vaccines did and the frequently vaccinated group retained those antibodies. This indicates that the frequently vaccinated are likely to be protected more broadly due the variety of vaccines they received in the past and the longevity of antibody titres.

\section{Objective 2}

Investigate HI antibody titres for infrequently vaccinated over 3 years where
they are vaccinated each each.

Hypothesis: post-vaccination titres and the pre/post vaccination titre rise
decreases each year.

\subsection{Data}

Table \ref{tab:cdc-participant-summary-obj2} contains sex, age and
vaccination history summaries.
The majority of subjects are
women and were around 46 years of age when the study started (2016).
Similar numbers of people were vaccinated 1, 2 or 3 times in the years before
the study.

\input{../data-summary/cdc-participant-summary-obj2.tex}

\subsection{Titres}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-israel} shows GMTs for each virus at each timepoint for each year for the Israel sample. Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-peru} shows the same for the Peru sample.
Some viruses (e.g. Bilthoven) do not show much change across the timepoints in
any year. Some viruses (e.g. A/Switzerland/8060/17e) consistently show the pattern of post-vaccination titres being the highest and post-season titres being between pre and post vaccination ones.

	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-peru}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-israel} shows GMTs for each virus at each timepoint for each year for the Israel sample. Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-peru} shows the same for the Peru sample. These are similar to Figures \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-israel} and \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-peru} but layed out such that the same timepoint can be easily compared across years. The timepoint titres appear fairly similar across years. For some viruses (e.g., A/Brisbane/10/07p), the titres appear to increase in subsequent years as compared to previous years for every timepoint.

	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-peru}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Vaccine responses}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-vax-resp-virus} shows vaccine responses (ratio of post and pre vaccination titres)
for all participants across the 3 years of the study for each virus for the Israel and Peru samples. Vaccine
response does not follow a consistent pattern across 3 years for all viruses. For some viruses
there is a pattern of decreasing response (e.g., A/Singapore/16-0019/16e), for some the response stays similar (e.g., A/Netherlands/178/95), for some it increases
(e.g., A/Sydney/22/18), for some the year 1 and 3 show similar responses while
year 2 shows a lower response (e.g., A/Kansas/14/17e).

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj2-vax-resp-virus.pdf}
	\caption{Ratios of post-vaccination titres to pre-vaccination titres and 95\% confidence intervals for each virus for each study year for the Israel and Peru samples. The shaded region indicates the vaccine strain (study year 1 and 2 - A/Hong Kong/4801/14e, study year 3 - A/Singapore/16-0019/16e).}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-vax-resp-virus}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-average-response} shows average responses for each individual across the 3 years (i.e., for each individual, the ratios of pre and post-vaccination titres were averaged across viruses for each year).
The pattern is inconsistent with some individuals showing a decreasing response,
some - increasing and some with year 2 being either higher of lower
than years 1 and 3.
The egg viruses show higher responses for some individuals.

	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-average-response}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Circulating strains}

The list of viruses for each clade is in Table \ref{tab:cdc-clade-viruses}.Frequencies of different virus clades during the study period are in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-clade-freq}. The timing of sample collection is in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-bleed-dates}. The most relevant set of frequencies is the first halves of 2017-2019 for Israel and the second halves of 2016-2018 for Peru as they appear to be the influenza "seasons" that the titres belong to.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj2-bleed-dates.pdf}
	\caption{Bleed dates for objective 2 data. Each horizontal line represents a participant. Points are bleeds.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-bleed-dates}
\end{figure}

The procedure for calculating the "GMT against circulating strains" was the same as in objective 1. The averages for each individual are in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-ind-circulating}. The yearly GMTs are in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmt-circulating}. The Israel site shows decreaseing titres in subsequent years for all timepoints except pre-vaccination for egg viruses where there is an increase in year 2. The Peru site shows a decrease in year 2 and a return to almost year 1 levels in year 3 (especially pronounced for cell viruses).

	\caption{Means of weighted average titres agains circulating strains for each year. Split by egg/cell and site.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-gmt-circulating}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interpretation}

There is no clear trend of a decreasing vaccine response on the whole serology
panel. Nor is there a clear trend of post-vaccianation titres being lower in subsequent years as compared to previous years. This runs somewhat contrary to
the data for objective 1. For example, the post-vaccination titres in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-gmts} are generally higher for the infrequently vaccinated but the post-vaccination titres in Figures \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-israel} and \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-peru} do not show the equivalent pattern of decresing in subsequent years as compared to previous years (i.e. as subjects become more highly vaccinated). There are examples of the opposite pattern (e.g., A/Sydney/22/18), where the post-vaccination GMTs appear to increase as subjects become more highly vaccinated.

When considering only the circulating strains, the Israel site data appears to be in line with objective 1 data showing decreasing post-vaccination and post-season titres with subsequent years. The Peru site data does not show that pattern - there is a large decrease in year 2 (for cell viruses) and a return close to year 1 levels in year 3.
