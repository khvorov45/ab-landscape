\section{Objective 1}

Compare post-vaccination HI antibody titres for frequently vaccinated (in the past) vs infrequently vaccinated.

Hypothesis: post-vaccination titres and the pre/post vaccination titre rise
is lower in the frequently vaccinated.

\subsection{Data}

All data analysed for objective 1 comes from the Israel study sample.

Table \ref{tab:cdc-participant-summary-obj1} contains sex and age summaries.
The majority of subjects in both the frequent and the infrequent group are
women and were around 40 years of age when the study started (2016).

\input{../data-summary/cdc-participant-summary-obj1.tex}

\subsection{HI titres}

Geometric mean titres for each virus at each timepoint for each group (frequently
vaccinated vs infrequently vaccinated) are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-gmts}.
Pre-vaccination GMTs are generally close to the same
or higher for all viruses for the frequently vaccinated.
Post-vaccination GMTs are generally close to the same or higher in the infrequently vaccinated with
the exception of the Bilthoven viruses (which show the same pattern
of frequently vaccinated GMTs being higher at every
timepoint). The pattern of GMTs for the post-season timepoint is close to that
of post-vaccination except that titres are generally more similar between the
frequently and infrequently vaccinated.

	\caption{Geometric mean titres and 95\% confidence intervals for each virus at each timepoint for the frequently and the infrequently vaccinated.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-gmts}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HI titre changes}

Ratio of post-vaccination titres to pre-vaccination titres is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-diffs}. Ratios are higher for the infrequently
vaccinated for the majority of viruses.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj1-timepoint-diffs.pdf}
	\caption{Ratios of post-vaccination titres to pre-vaccination titres and 95\% confidence intervals for each virus for the frequently and the infrequently vaccinated.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-diffs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interpretation}

The vaccine response (titre change between post and pre vaccination timepoints)
appears to be lower in the frequently vaccinated. However, the actual
post-vaccination titres between the two groups are fairly close for most viruses.

Both groups had low titres against A/South Australia/34/2019 and A/Sydney/22/2018 pre-vaccination. Those who were infrequently vaccinated had those titres rise to above 20 (on average) while the frequently vaccinated titres stayed below 20 (on average). This indicates that the depressed vaccine response mey be most evident for viruses that individuals have no/low titres against before vaccination (which could be novel strains, for example).

Neither group had a strong response to the Bilthoven viruses. However, the frequently vaccinated group had higher titres against them throughout the season. This is likely due to the fact that while the current vaccine did not generate antibody production against these viruses, one of the previous vaccines did and the frequently vaccinated group retained those antibodies. This indicates that the frequently vaccinated are likely to be protected more broadly due the variety of vaccines they received in the past and the longevity of antibody titres.

\section{Objective 2}

Investigate HI antibody titres for infrequently vaccinated over 3 years where
they are vaccinated each each.

Hypothesis: post-vaccination titres and the pre/post vaccination titre rise
decreases each year.

\subsection{Data}

Table \ref{tab:cdc-participant-summary-obj2} contains sex, age and
vaccination history summaries.
The majority of subjects are
women and were around 46 years of age when the study started (2016).
Similar numbers of people were vaccinated 1, 2 or 3 times in the years before
the study.

\input{../data-summary/cdc-participant-summary-obj2.tex}

\subsection{Titres}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-israel} shows GMTs for each virus at each timepoint for each year for the Israel sample. Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-peru} shows the same for the Peru sample.
Some viruses (e.g. Bilthoven) do not show much change across the timepoints in
any year. Some viruses (e.g. A/Switzerland/8060/17e) consistently show the pattern of post-vaccination titres being the highest and post-season titres being between pre and post vaccination ones.

	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-peru}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-israel} shows GMTs for each virus at each timepoint for each year for the Israel sample. Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-peru} shows the same for the Peru sample. These are similar to Figures \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-israel} and \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-1-peru} but layed out such that the same timepoint can be easily compared across years. The timepoint titres appear fairly similar across years. For some viruses (e.g., A/Brisbane/10/07p), the titres appear to increase in subsequent years as compared to previous years for every timepoint.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Vaccine responses}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-vax-resp-virus} shows vaccine responses (ratio of post and pre vaccination titres)
for all participants across the 3 years of the study for each virus. Vaccine
response does not follow a consistent pattern across 3 years for all viruses. For some viruses
there is a pattern of decreasing response (e.g., A/Singapore/16-0019/16e), for some the response stays similar (e.g., A/Netherlands/178/95), for some it increases
(e.g., A/Sydney/22/18), for some the year 1 and 3 show similar responses while
year 2 shows a lower response (e.g., A/Kansas/14/17e).

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Ratios of post-vaccination titres to pre-vaccination titres and 95\% confidence intervals for each virus for each study year for the Israel and Peru samples.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-vax-resp-virus}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-average-response} shows average responses for each individual across the 3 years (i.e., for each individual, the ratios of pre and post-vaccination titres were averaged across viruses for each year).
The pattern is inconsistent with some individuals showing a decreasing response,
some - increasing and some with year 2 being either higher of lower
than years 1 and 3.
The egg viruses show higher responses for some individuals.

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{../data-summary/cdc-obj2-average-response.pdf}
	\caption{Averaged (across viruses) responses (post/pre vaccination titre ratios) for each individual at each study year. Responses were averaged across cell and egg viruses separately.}
	\label{fig:cdc-obj2-average-response}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interpretation}

There is no clear trend of a decreasing vaccine response on the whole serology
panel. Nor is there a clear trend of post-vaccianation titres being lower in subsequent years as compared to previous years. This runs somewhat contrary to
the data for objective 1. For example, the post-vaccination titres in Figure \ref{fig:cdc-obj1-timepoint-gmts} are generally higher for the infrequently vaccinated but the post-vaccination titres in Figures \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-israel} and \ref{fig:cdc-obj2-gmts-2-peru} do not show the equivalent pattern of decresing in subsequent years as compared to previous years (i.e. as subjects become more highly vaccinated). There are examples of the opposite pattern (e.g., A/Sydney/22/18), where the post-vaccination GMTs appear to increase as subjects become more highly vaccinated.
