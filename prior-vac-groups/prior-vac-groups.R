# Annette's original email:

# We have talked about further exploring whether there is evidence that some
# sera may be focused on particular epitopes using reverse genetics viruses that
# each have one of the  five antigenic sites messed up by substituting with
# amino acids from H10 HA. Iâ€™m finding it almost impossible to choose sera that
# may be of interest by just looking at them and there vaccine histories.

# We know that people responded better with greater rises & somewhat higher post
# vaccine titres if they had fewer prior vaccinations, but can we investigate if
# there are any trends in terms of the regions/clades against which people
# responded best and the sequences of vaccines they received (not just number).
# For example, there is a small group of people who only received vaccine in
# 2015 and then again in 2018, and others who only received vaccine in 2014 and
# then 2018 (Y3 vaccine group). There is also a group in Y 1 who only received
# vaccine in 2013. In the first instance, could we at least see if the area
# under the curve for geometric titre ratio against 2007-2019 strains clusters
# in any way by sequence of vaccines. Not sure how many sequences there are, or
# how many there are with a reasonable n, but maybe not too many?? Objective 1
# has 357 people of whom 120 had some prior vaccination, but were not vaccinated
# every year. Other than area under the curve, are you able to extract
# information about where the peak of titre rise occurs in terms of virus or
# clade (perhaps doing this with an without excluding the vaccine strain)?
