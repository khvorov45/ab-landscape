Immunogenicity measures for the RMH sample.
All relate to the post-vax timepoint.
Where the "virus" column contains multiple viruses it means that
each individual's log-titres were averaged across those viruses
before calculating the measures for the cohort.

gmt_uncorrected - geometric mean titre.
gmr_uncorrected - geometric mean rise as compared to the pre-vax timepoint.
gmt_corrected - geometric mean of corrected post-vax titres
gmr_corrected - geometric mean of corrected ratios beteween pre-vax and
post-vax titres

seroprot_uncorrected - proportion with titres above 40 at post-vax
seroprot_only_below40 - proportion with titres above 40 at post-vax but only
for those with titres below 40 pre-vax

Format:

Mean (95% CI) [count]
Percentage (95% CI) [success / total]

seroconv - if pre-vax below 10 then post-vax above 40, otherwise at least a
4-fold increase.

Post-vax titre correction was done like this:

LogTitre (post-vax, corrected) = LogTitre (post-vax) - b * (LogTitre (pre-vax) - log(10))

Where b comes from

LogTitre (post-vax) = a + b * LogTitre (pre-vax)

Ratio of pre-vax/post-vax titres was corrected like this:

Titre (corrected) / 10

Interpretation of corrections: GMT/GMR estimated as if everyone started at 10.
